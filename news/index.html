</header>
<article><p>Hey fellas, great news! The <tt>lovely</tt> npm package aka the console line tools were just updated to the version <tt>1.9.0</tt>!</p>

<h2>What&#39;s New?</h2>

<ol>
<li>Update to <tt>node.js-0.10+</tt> and all the latest <tt>npm</tt> packages</li>
<li><p>Switching from <tt>should.js</tt> to <tt>chai.js</tt>. Basically this means that now you can switch between testing styles and use asserts or should or expect matches in your projects</p>
<pre data-lang='coffee'>{Test, assert} = require('lovely')&#x000A;# or&#x000A;{Test, should} = require('lovely')&#x000A;# or&#x000A;{Test, expect} = require('lovely')</pre></li>
<li><p>The internals of the testing utilities were reworked to provide better speed and usability. Firstly there is no <tt>module</tt> in <tt>Test.load</tt> anymore, you can just load directly what you want</p>
<pre data-lang='coffee'>{Test, should} = require('lovely')&#x000A;&#x000A;describe "Awesome Package", -&gt;&#x000A;  AwesomePackage = null&#x000A;&#x000A;  before Test.load (build)-&gt;&#x000A;    AwesomePackage = build&#x000A;&#x000A;  it "should be awesome", -&gt;&#x000A;    AwesomePackage.should.equal "awesomeness"</pre>
<p>Also, now you can run every test individually with the <tt>lovely</tt> cmd</p>
<pre data-lang='bash'>$ lovely test/something_test.coffee</pre>
<p>And, you can run your tests agains a minified version of the package builds, just in case you want to make sure that nothing was wreaked during the compression process</p>
<pre data-lang='bash'>$ lovely test -m&#x000A;$ lovely test --minify</pre></li>
</ol>

<p>That&#39;s all we have for today fellas.
Enjoy!</p>

<article><p>Hey fellas!</p>

<p>Two news</p>

<ol>
<li>From now on lovely.io will use GitHub as the main auth-provider. Which kinda makes sense considering the task we&#39;re doing here :)</li>
<li>The new landing page was rolled out! Check it out, let me know if it makes sense</li>
</ol>

</header>
<article><p>Hey fellas, great news!</p>

<p>The <tt>lovely</tt> cli tools were updated to the version <tt>1.8.0</tt> and as per usual we have a whole bunch of new features!</p>

<p>1) Vanilla builds. Basically now you can build anything with the <tt>lovely build</tt> tool. Your projects don&#39;t have to be lovely.io modules anymore, as long as it has <tt>main.coffee</tt> file, you can make a vanilla build out of it by simply specifying the <tt>--vanilla</tt> option!</p>

<p>2) CSS dumps, the <tt>lovely build</tt> also now supports the <tt>--no-styles</tt> option, in this case it won&#39;t try to inline your css into the javascript file and will simply dump the styles in a separated build file. That&#39;s useful in case when you use the lovely tools for non lovely.io projects building.</p>

<p>3) The <tt>lovely server</tt> now can transparently serve <tt>.sass</tt>,  <tt>.scss</tt> and <tt>.styl</tt> files to the browser and convert them on fly into css. So be happy and write any styles in anything you like.</p>

<p>4) Lovely.IO is now officially supports SCSS. You can write your package styles in it if you like.</p>

<p>5) The <tt>lovely install</tt> and <tt>lovely uninstall</tt> commands semantic was changed to the more natural one</p>
<pre data-lang='unspecified'>lovely install something-1.2.3 something-2.3.4 ...&#x000A;lovely uninstall module module ...</pre>
<p>6) The <tt>package.json</tt> file now can be named <tt>lovely.json</tt>. That is in case if you need to make a package that will be distributed between several different platforms and you need different settings for lovely.io.</p>

<p>7) The default development server styles were updated with some nicefications.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s about it.
Enjoy! :)</p>

<div class='title'><a href="/news/lovely-cli-tools-update">Lovely CLI tools update</a></div>
</header>
<article><p>Great news everyone! The <tt>lovely</tt> CLI tools were just updated to the version <tt>1.7.0</tt>!</p>

<p>The change log goes like that</p>

<ul>
<li><p><tt>lovely test</tt> command was added. This is a nice shortcut that runs all the console tests that your package has in the <tt>test/</tt> folder and takes case of all the <tt>mocha</tt> extra machinery.</p>

<p>Now you can just run <tt>lovely test</tt> in someones package and make sure that you didn&#39;t break anything, without actually mangling with <tt>mocha</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>lovely dump</tt> command was added. This command allows you to build a set of packages with all their dependencies into one single static file, which you can then host on your own server.</p>

<p>This is useful if you wanna work with SSL on your server or have your own static version of the scripts for any other reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Now you can specify default languages for your new projects in the <tt>~/.lovelyrc</tt> file</p>
<pre data-lang='unspecified'>echo "lang = js,css" &gt;&gt; ~/.lovelyrc</pre>
<p>By default it will be <tt>coffee,sass</tt> but you can specify any pair from <tt>coffee</tt>, <tt>js</tt>, <tt>css</tt>, <tt>stylus</tt> and <tt>sass</tt> in there.</p></li>
<li><p>The <tt>lovely server</tt> command now can compile non-project related <tt>coffee</tt> files on fly. Say if you&#39;re working on
something that is not a lovely.io package and use <tt>lovely</tt> as a simple server to serve your local files, now
you can write your code in <tt>coffee</tt> and just include those files on your page as they are. Lovely server will
automatically convert them into javascript and send to your browser.</p></li>
<li><p>A bunch of shortcuts were added for the <tt>lovely</tt> commands, you can now run things like <tt>lovely s</tt>, <tt>lovely -h</tt>,
<tt>lovely -v</tt> and so on.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

</header>
<article><p>Hey folks, great news!</p>

<p>We reached the next major milestone in the lovely.io development and delivering today the automatic documentation hosting for your projects.</p>

<p>Now all markdown documents that you save in the <tt>docs</tt> folder of your project, will be automatically uploaded to the server the next time you call <tt>lovely publish</tt></p>

<p>The better news is that you don&#39;t have to write the documentation yourself. The <tt>lovely</tt> <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a> package was updated and now you can generate all your docs from your source code with the <tt>lovely docs</tt> command!</p>

<p>No more hassle with documentation! Just keep your code clean and lovely.io will take care of the rest.</p>

<p>All the <a href="http://lovely.io/tags/STL">STL</a> packages documentation is already on the server. Check it out <a href="http://lovely.io/packages/dom/docs/element/navigation.coffee">dom documentation</a>!</p>

<div class='title'><a href="/news/the-assets-server-updates">The Assets Server Updates</a></div>
</header>
<article><p>Hey everyone, great news!</p>

<p>You know that lovely.io automatically hosts static assets for your packages, and if you like the feature, there is a great news, because there were several major updates in the lovely.io server to improve the way we handle static assets.</p>

<p>1) Firstly, now all the new assets will be marked with SHA1 hashes and served by using this signature as it&#39;s primary ID. This basically means that all your static assets will be cached independently from your actual javascript packages. As the result, if you didn&#39;t change images, and only your scripting was changed, the users of your updated package will download only the scripting, the static assets will be reused from the previous versions.</p>

<p>2) Now you can host not just images, but fonts as well. Using fonts as collections of icons is becoming more and more popular. the <a href="/packages/ui">lovely.io ui core</a> since the version 2.0 will be using <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome">FontAwesome</a> as the default icon set.</p>

<p>3) The <tt>lovely</tt> CLI tools were updated with fixes and patches that allow the fonts to be served and published at the lovely.io server.</p>
